## ðŸš€ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bilalkarakira/Employee-Leave-Requests-Management.git
cd Employee-Leave-Requests-Management
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
composer install
npm install
```

### 3. Database Setup (pgAdmin + PostgreSQL)

This application uses **PostgreSQL** as the database. Below are the steps to configure it locally using **pgAdmin**.

#### 1. Install PostgreSQL & pgAdmin

- Download and install PostgreSQL: [https://www.postgresql.org/download/](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
- Install pgAdmin (GUI tool): [https://www.pgadmin.org/download/](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/)

#### 2. Open pgAdmin & Create a New Database

1. Launch **pgAdmin** and connect to your PostgreSQL server (you might need to enter the password you set during PostgreSQL installation).
2. In the left sidebar, right-click on **Databases** â†’ **Create** â†’ **Database**.
3. Enter a name for your database (e.g., `leave_management`) and click **Save**.

#### 3. Update `.env` File in Laravel Project

Once the database is created, open your Laravel projectâ€™s `.env` file and update the following lines with your PostgreSQL details:

```env
DB_CONNECTION=pgsql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=5432
DB_DATABASE=leave_management
DB_USERNAME=your_postgres_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_postgres_password
```

### 4. Environment Configuration

```bash
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
```

Update `.env` with your database and mail configuration. You can use the `.env.example` file as a reference, for local development I am using pgAdmin and pgSQL for local testing.

### 5. Run Migrations

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### 6. Build Frontend Assets (Tailwind)

```bash
npm run dev   # for development
npm run build # for production
```

### 7. Run the Development Server

```bash
php artisan serve
```

Visit: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

## Notes

* Tailwind CSS must be correctly configured in `resources/css/app.css` and built using `vite` or Laravel Mix.
* If you add new views, ensure they are included in the `content` array of `tailwind.config.js`.
* A filter by status (e.g., Pending, Approved, Rejected) for the Leave Requests page was considered for enhanced usability but is not yet implemented. This can be added in future versions to improve navigation and request management.

```js
// Example tailwind.config.js content section
content: [
  './resources/**/*.blade.php',
  './resources/**/*.js',
  './resources/**/*.vue',
],
```
