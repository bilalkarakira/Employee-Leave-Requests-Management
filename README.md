## Notes

* Tailwind CSS must be correctly configured in `resources/css/app.css` and built using `vite` or Laravel Mix.
* If you add new views, ensure they are included in the `content` array of `tailwind.config.js`.
* A filter by status (e.g., Pending, Approved, Rejected) for the Leave Requests page was considered for enhanced usability but is not yet implemented. This can be added in future versions to improve navigation and request management.

```js
// Example tailwind.config.js content section
content: [
  './resources/**/*.blade.php',
  './resources/**/*.js',
  './resources/**/*.vue',
],
```
